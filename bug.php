This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to how it handles array keys.  When you use a non-string value as an array key, PHP will automatically cast it to a string. This can lead to unexpected results, especially when using numeric keys that might cast to the same string representation.

```php
<?php
$arr = [];
$arr[10] = 'ten';
$arr[10.0] = 'ten point zero';
$arr['10'] = 'ten as string';

echo "Count: " . count($arr) . "\n"; // Outputs 2, not 3
print_r($arr);
//Output:
//Array
//(
//    [10] => ten as string
//    [10.0] => ten point zero
//)
?>
```
